# Magento 2 Order Attachment

Allowing customers to provide maximum information to fulfill their orders help the business improve the order fulfillment experience. However, the default Magento 2 does not allow the customers to attach various file types while placing the order. Hence, Meetanshi has developed [***Magento 2 Order Attachment***](https://meetanshi.com/magento-2-order-attachment.html) extension.

The extension facilitates the customers to attach file types of jpg, jpeg, png, zip, rar, docx, doc, pdf, bmp, gif, xls, xlsx at the time of placing the order.

Attaching order documents with the corresponding orders makes it easy for the admin to complete the order delivery without any mistakes!
